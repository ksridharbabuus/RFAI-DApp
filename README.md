# Request for RFAI Portal

This DApp is for RFAI Portal where users are request for a AI Service. This project also includes necessary contracts and the DApp is built using Drizzle Framework with ReactJS. 

## Installation

1. Install Truffle and Ganache CLI globally. If you prefer, the graphical version of Ganache works as well!
    ```javascript
    npm install -g truffle
    npm install -g ganache-cli
    ```

2. Clone the code from Github @ https://github.com/singnet/RFAI-DApp . Install the dependencies by running npm install Command. 

    ```javascript
    git clone https://github.com/singnet/RFAI-DApp 
    ```

    ```javascript
    npm install
    ```

3. Run the development blockchain, we recommend passing in a blocktime. Otherwise, its difficult to track things like loading indicators because Ganache will mine instantly.
    ```javascript
    // 3 second blocktime.
    ganache-cli -b 3
    ```

4. Compile and migrate the smart contracts. Note inside the development console we don't preface commands with `truffle`.
    ```javascript
    compile
    migrate
    ```

5. Run the webpack server for front-end hot reloading (outside the development console). Smart contract changes must be manually recompiled and migrated. Make sure that the network & contract addresses are updated in the respective locations (build -> contracts)
    ```javascript
    // Serves the front-end on http://localhost:3000
    npm run start
    ```

6. Truffle can run tests written in Solidity or JavaScript against your smart contracts. Note the command varies slightly if you're in or outside of the development console.
    ```javascript
    // If inside the development console.
    test

    // If outside the development console..
    truffle test
    ```

7. Test is included for testing React components. Compile your contracts before running Jest, or you may receive some file not found errors.
    ```javascript
    // Run Jest outside of the development console for front-end component tests.
    npm run test
    ```

8. To build the application for production, use the build command. A production build will be in the build_webpack folder.
    ```javascript
    npm run build
    ```
